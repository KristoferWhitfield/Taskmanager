# Taskmanager
Here's an application where users can enter their name and task so teammates can keep track of projects.

## Hows It's Made:

Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, JSON, Express, EJS, MongoDB.

The project uses a mongoDB database to store the user's inputs. When the delete button is clicked, it removes the
input from the database. When the delete method is ran, the app refreshes showing the removed database entry.
